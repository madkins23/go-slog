TODO

* Samber/Zerolog and Samber/Zap print duration in nanos WithGroup
  but millis in normal message functions (e.g. Info()).
* Chanchal/Zap prints the message function attributes at the top level
  instead of WithGroup as expected.
* Is GroupInline general or specific to Info() and the like?
* Check for package compilation
  - Utility to process entries from Go package-linkage whatever
    in order to create usable tree view.
  - `go mod graph` only shows the `go.mod` dependencies.
  - Package repository doesn't generate executable.
* Is there a way to avoid crashing when updates to slog handlers blow up?
  - Currently this is an issue with zerolog 1.32 breaking phsym/zeroslog.
