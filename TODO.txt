# TODO

* Warning levels in top-level README.md
? Default chart size on score page to smallest one that contains all items
? Workflow keep-alive
  https://github.com/liskin/gh-workflow-keepalive
? Show complex definitions, log traces, and attribute groups on a web page
* Use json.Expect and reflect.DeepEqual()/assert.Equal() more often
* Creator could have:
  - pre-logMap filters to clean up bad log formats
  - post-logMap filters to clean up logMap after parsing JSON
  - feeder fn to load bytes.Buffer with JSON for non-standard logging
  ? should this go into some bytes.Buffer/map[string]any result object?
    - NewResultObject(preFilters, postFilters) -> *ResultObject
    - ro.Writer() -> io.Writer
    - ro.Push(b []byte) -> error // instead of Writer()
    - ro.PreFilter() -> error    // pre-logMap filters
    - ro.LogMap() -> (map[string]any, error)
    - ro.PostFilter() -> error   // post-logMap filters

# Less Likely

* Should handlers/flash/pools.go be moved to internal (or infra) as a utility?
  Maybe not bother until it's needed somewhere else.
* Is there a way to figure out which handlers can use ReplaceAttr effectively
  based on which warnings they throw?  See Data section at end for some thoughts.
* ReplAttr filters:
  * caller -> source group
  * source group -> caller
* Check for package compilation
  - Utility to process entries from Go package-linkage whatever
    in order to create usable tree view.
  - `go mod graph` only shows the `go.mod` dependencies.
  - Package repository doesn't generate executable.
* Is there a way to avoid crashing when updates to slog handlers blow up?
  - Probably not.

# Global

* Should slog.Attr cache the value of Kind()?
* Why is there one number of allocs in benchmark results?
  - there are 61 buckets in the data I found
  - seems like it's just choosing one for some reason
  - pick the biggest bucket?
* Would slog speed up if slog.Attr cached the value of Keep()?
