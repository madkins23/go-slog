TODO

* More complex logging cases
* slog.Handler that traces calls to Handler
  - Push indent / pop on defer?
  - Use that to trace calls.
* Check for package compilation
  - Utility to process entries from Go package-linkage whatever
    in order to create usable tree view.
  - `go mod graph` only shows the `go.mod` dependencies.
  - Package repository doesn't generate executable.
* Is there a way to avoid crashing when updates to slog handlers blow up?
  - Currently this is an issue with zerolog 1.32 breaking phsym/zeroslog.
