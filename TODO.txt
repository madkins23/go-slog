TODO

* Charts alphabetizing in wrong direction (vertically)
* Check for package compilation
  - Utility to process entries from Go package-linkage whatever
    in order to create usable tree view.
* Is there a way to avoid crashing when updates to slog handlers blow up?
  - Currently this is an issue with zerolog 1.32 breaking phsym/zeroslog.
