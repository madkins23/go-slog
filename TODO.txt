* Is there a way to avoid crashing when update to slog handlers blow up?
  - Currently this is an issue with zerolog 1.32 breaking phsym/zeroslog.
* IMHO Note
  - Especially warning levels
  - Just advising, YMMV
  - No authority to make anyone fix stuff
  - Provide utility vs. speed trade-offs for users
* Move package-specific Readme notes into package doc.go files where possible.
* Add references to other slog handlers into top-level Readme.
  - Then can close some of the open tabs in my Chrome slog group.
* Add more slog handlers.
* Re-check bench warnings for missing methods ?!?
* Auto-register warnings.
