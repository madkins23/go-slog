TODO

* Move package-specific Readme notes into package doc.go files where possible.
* More description attached to warnings?
  - Maybe use markdown?
* Re-check bench warnings for missing methods ?!?
* Is there a way to avoid crashing when update to slog handlers blow up?
  - Currently this is an issue with zerolog 1.32 breaking phsym/zeroslog.
