TODO

* Overlapping labels in scoring chart still an issue
  - now three in a row on right vertical axis
* Is there a way to figure out which handlers can use ReplaceAttr effectively
  based on which warnings they throw?  See Data section at end for some thoughts.

Less Likely

* ReplAttr filters:
  * caller -> source group
  * source group -> caller
* Fix deprecated/wrong shit in *.gohtml files
  X simple CSS classes
  X use of col.width attribute
  X use of width attribute on td
  - irritating warnings that it can't find my files
* Check for package compilation
  - Utility to process entries from Go package-linkage whatever
    in order to create usable tree view.
  - `go mod graph` only shows the `go.mod` dependencies.
  - Package repository doesn't generate executable.
* Is there a way to avoid crashing when updates to slog handlers blow up?
  - Probably not.

Global

* Should slog.Attr cache the value of Kind()?
* Why is there one number of allocs in benchmark results?
  - there are 61 buckets in the data I found
  - seems like it's just choosing one for some reason
  - pick the biggest bucket?
* Would slog speed up if slog.Attr cached the value of Keep()?
