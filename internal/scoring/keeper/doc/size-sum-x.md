The X-axis for the `Size` scoring chart shows the score derived from verification warnings
for benchmarks with "large" log records.

The score is calculated using the score weights shown to the right
which are applied to the warning levels during calculation.

The benchmarks that are run to populate this axis are shown in the **Included** list to the right.
