The `Default` scoring algorithm is the original (and initially the only) scoring algorithm.
This algorithm uses benchmark and verification warnings to generate results.

The `Default` score chart graphs various `slog` handlers by speed versus functionality.
This concept was the impetus behind creating scoring algorithms and charts.
On this chart the X axis is a warning score and
the Y axis is a benchmark (performance) score for each handler.

Going by the "score" values can be misleading,
as they roll up a lot of different data items, hiding the detail.
Use the checkboxes on the Scores table at the top to make detail tables visible.
Further buttons above the detail tables show different classes of data.
