The `Default` scoring algorithm is the original (and initially the only) scoring algorithm.
The `Default` algorithm uses benchmark and verification warnings to generate results.

The `Default` score chart graphs various `slog` handlers by speed versus functionality.
This concept of this chart was the impetus behind creating scoring algorithms and charts.
