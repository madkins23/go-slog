The Y-axis for the `Default` scoring chart shows the score derived
for benchmarks with "small" log records.

The score is calculated using the score weights shown to the right
which are applied to the several specific benchmark result values.

The benchmarks that are run to populate this axis are the set of _all_ benchmarks
minus the one(s) shown in the **Excluded** list to the right.
