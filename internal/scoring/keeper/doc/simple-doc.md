The `Simple` scoring algorithm, like the `Default` algorithm,
uses benchmark and verification warnings to generate results.
In this case the weight tables are simpler, ignoring some of the input data.

These two sources are also graphed, as they are for the `Default` algorithm,
comparing the various `slog` handlers by speed versus functionality.
This is basically the same as the `Default` scorekeeper but with different
weights for the benchmark and warning data.
