The Y-axis for the `Default` scoring chart shows the score derived from running benchmarks
with simpler axis weights.

The score is calculated using the score weights shown to the right
which are applied to the several specific benchmark result values.

The benchmarks that are run to populate this axis are the ones in
the `Included` list to the right.
