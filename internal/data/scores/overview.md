The algorithm behind the scores shown on this page are somewhat arbitrary.
Many different algorithms could have been used, but after careful thought
the one discussed below was considered to be "good enough".

The code for the scoring algorithm was carefully implemented behind an `interface`.
There is currently only one "default" code module and no simple way to
replace one scoring algorithm with another, but it wouldn't be hard.
